# Word-Guess-Game

Link to deployed website: https://kevinbevil.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/

A game in which a random word (here an orchestra instrument) is chosen, and the user guesses letters by pushing letters on the keyboard.  The user has 15 guesses.  If the letter is correct, it immediately shows up in the hidden correct word where an underscore was before.  

The wins and losses are tracked, and stored in local storage.
